    <h1>Lasagna</h1>

    <p>by Chef John</p>

    <p>There are only two things you need for great lasagna: a thick, rich, 
        super-meaty meat sauce and lots of it, and a ricotta filling where 
        only the finest cheeses are welcomed. For the sauce, I love a 
        combination of half Italian sausage and half lean ground beef. 
        I also like lots of sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Bulk Italian Sausage - 1 pound</li>
        <li>Lean ground beef - 1.5 pounds</li>
        <li>Fresh mushrooms - 8 ounces (Chopped coarsely)</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper - 0.5 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Dried Italian herb seasoning - 0.5 teaspoon (Optional)</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes - 0.25 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Marinara Sauce - 6 cups</li>
        <li>Water - 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Eggs - 2</li>
        <li>Whole-milk ricotta cheese - 2 pounds</li>
        <li>Mozzarella - 8 ounces (diced)</li>
        <li>Freshly shredded Parmigiano Reggiano cheese - 0.66 cup</li>
        <li>Salt - 1 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper - 0.25 teaspoon</li>
        <li>Cayenne pepper - to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley - 0.25 cup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Start with the meat</h4>
            <p>Place sausage and ground beef into a large saucepan over medium 
                heat; cook and stir until meat is browned and crumbly, about 
                10 minutes. Break the meat apart as it cooks. Stir in mushrooms, 
                1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, Italian herb 
                seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Turn heat to medium-high and 
                cook until mushrooms have given off their juices and bottom of 
                pan is almost dry.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Create the Marinara sauce</h4>
            <p>Pour prepared marinara sauce into meat mixture. Pour water into marinara 
                sauce jar and shake to get all the sauce out of the jar; add to mixture. 
                Reduce heat to low and simmer until meat is extremely tender, about 2 
                hours. Add a little more water if sauce becomes too thick. Skim excess 
                fat from surface of the sauce and season with more salt and black pepper, 
                if needed. Turn off heat.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Heat up the oven</h4>
            <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Mix up the cheese</h4>
            <p>Beat eggs in a large bowl and stir in ricotta cheese, 8 ounces diced 
                mozzarella cheese, and 2/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Season cheese 
                mixture with 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne pepper; 
                mix in parsley.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Cook the lasagna sheets</h4>
            <p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, 
                stirring occasionally, until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 
                minutes. Drain and rinse noodles and set aside in a bowl of cold water.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Build your lasagna in layers</h4>
            <p>Spread 1/4 the sauce into the bottom of a 10x15-inch baking pan. Top with 1/3 
                of the noodles and spread 1/2 the ricotta cheese mixture over noodles. Spread 1/4 of
                the meat sauce over the cheese, top with 1/3 of the noodles, and spread remaining 1/2 
                the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Spread 1/4 of the meat sauce over the cheese 
                filling. Tap the casserole dish lightly on a sturdy work surface to settle 
                the layers. Arrange last 1/3 of the noodles over sauce and spread remaining 1/4 of
                the sauce over the noodles. Dot top of the casserole with 4 ounces diced 
                fresh mozzarella cheese and sprinkle with 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Get the lasagna oven-ready</h4>
            <p>Cover casserole with aluminum foil, being sure not to touch the top of the 
                casserole with the foil. Place casserole onto a baking sheet to catch spills.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Bake the lasagna in the oven</h4>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove foil and cook until lasagna 
                is golden brown and bubbling, 30 to 35 more minutes. Let set for 20 minutes before 
                cutting into squares.
